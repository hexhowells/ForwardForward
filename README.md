# Forward Forward Algorithm
Running experiments on models described in the [Forward-Forward paper](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/FFA13.pdf).

Model is trained on MNIST and produces a 0.03% accuracy after 3 epochs. Negative training data is created by embedding the label into the input image using the first 10 pixels.
